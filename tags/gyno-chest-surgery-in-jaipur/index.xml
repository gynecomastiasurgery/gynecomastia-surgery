&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-what-is-gynecomastia-surgery&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What is gynecomastia surgery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gynecomastia surgery, also known as male breast reduction, is a surgical procedure designed to address the enlargement of male breast tissue. The surgery involves removing excess tissue and sculpting the chest for a more balanced and masculine appearance. It is a transformative solution for individuals seeking to overcome the physical and emotional challenges posed by gynecomastia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-am-i-a-suitable-candidate-for-male-breast-reduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Am I a suitable candidate for male breast reduction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates for gynecomastia surgery in Jaipur are typically men who have enlarged breast tissue that does not respond to non-surgical interventions. Good overall health and realistic expectations about the outcomes are important factors. Consulting with an experienced plastic surgeon like Dr. Vishal Purohit can help determine if you are a suitable candidate for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-what-is-the-recovery-process-like&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What is the recovery process like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery from gynecomastia surgery varies from person to person. Generally, patients can expect some mild discomfort, swelling, and bruising for the first few days.

Most patients can resume light activities within a week or two, with gradual return to more strenuous activities over the following weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-are-revision-surgeries-common&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Are revision surgeries common?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
