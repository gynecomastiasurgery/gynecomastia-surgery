&lt;h2 id=&#34;gynecomastia-surgery-options-in-jaipur-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gynecomastia Surgery Options in Jaipur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering gynecomastia surgery, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to be well-informed about the options available to you. Dr. Vishal Purohit&amp;rsquo;s clinic in Jaipur specializes in tailoring surgical approaches to meet your individual needs, ensuring the best possible outcomes for your chest fat removal surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liposuction:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the primary techniques used for gynecomastia surgery is liposuction. This minimally invasive procedure involves the removal of excess fat from the chest area using specialized tools. Through small incisions, the targeted fat cells are gently suctioned out, resulting in a more sculpted and masculine chest contour. Liposuction is particularly effective for individuals with a predominance of fatty tissue contributing to their gynecomastia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excision:&lt;/strong&gt; In cases where excess glandular tissue and skin are contributing to gynecomastia, an excision technique may be employed. This involves the surgical removal of the glandular tissue and excess skin through discreetly placed incisions. Excision is a suitable option for individuals with more significant tissue growth and sagging skin. Dr. Purohit&amp;rsquo;s skillful approach ensures minimal scarring and natural-looking results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combination Technique:&lt;/strong&gt; In some cases, a combination of liposuction and excision may be recommended to achieve optimal results. This approach allows for both fat removal and tissue excision, addressing various aspects of gynecomastia in a single procedure. Dr. Purohit will thoroughly assess your condition during the consultation to determine the most suitable technique or combination for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
